Hello world!

I am Jiwon, an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester studying B.S. in Computer Science. You can't find me on social media. Instead, check out my [personal website](https://jwpedia.com/about/) for more information. 

I write about technology, techno criticism, intentional living, and other topics of personal interest on my [blog](https://jwpedia.com/). I also write for the university's student newspaper as a tech columnist. My external writing portfolio is [here](https://jwpedia.com/writing). 

I am currently interested in writing simple, durable code for the web. My various projects are all available on public repos. My [CV](https://jwpedia.com/professional/) is also available online.
